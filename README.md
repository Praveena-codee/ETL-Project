Our client is  a WA University Sales and Marketing Department manager.

Project proposal:
WA university is planning their courses to run for next year. They have approached us and want to work with us to find out what courses will be popular in the next few years. 

To predict the in-demand courses/qualifications, we will look at the data in the growing industries, income levels of different qualifications and occupations. Our main source of data comes from ABS. 

Our plan is to work on the data on a 3 years period to keep data up to date and exclude data in FY2020 because this year the world went through the covid-19 pendemic and might not be reliable. We will use the data from the growing industries to extract 5 industries to work on. Then will move onto the income data of qualifications and occupations and filter the occupations to match up the top 5 industries. 

The end result will be showing WA university the in-demand occupations so that they can set up courses occordingly.
